from utils import preprocess_image

# Load the trained model
model = load_trained_model("weights/recaptcha_model_pro.keras")

# Preprocess image
img = preprocess_image("sample_captcha.png", target_size=(128, 128))

# Predict
predictions = model.predict(img)
class_names = np.load("weights/label_encoder_classes.npy")
predicted_class = class_names[np.argmax(predictions)]

print("Prediction:", predicted_class)
print("Confidence:", np.max(predictions))
```
